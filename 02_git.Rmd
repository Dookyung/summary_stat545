# R Markdown test drive

#### Overview

Here is the official R Markdown documentation: <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>

#### Step 0: Software installation and configuration

#### Step 1: Get ready to work

#### Step 2: Practice with RStudio's boilerplate R Markdown document

Do this: *File > New File > R Markdown ...*

  - Give it an informative title. 
  - Accept the default Author or edit if you wish.
  - Accept the default output format of HTML.
  - Click OK.
  
Click on "Knit HTML" or do *File > Knit Document*. RStudio should display a preview of the resulting HTML. 

#### Step 3: Take control of the output format

The magical process that turns your R Markdown to HTML is like so: `foo.Rmd --> foo.md --> foo.html`. 

**Output format** 

html:

``` yaml
    ---  
    title: "Something fascinating"  
    author: "Jenny Bryan"  
    date: "`r format(Sys.Date())`"
    output:  
      html_document:  
        keep_md: true  
    ---  
```

GitHub-flavored markdown:

``` yaml
    ---  
    title: "Something fascinating"  
    author: "Jenny Bryan"  
    date: "`r format(Sys.Date())`"
    output: github_document
    ---  
```

#### Step 4: Swap out the "guts" of the document

Insert an empty R chunk:

    ```{r}
    ## insert your brilliant WORKING code here
    ```

#### Step 5: Develop your report


#### Step 6: Publish your report


Creating, commiting, and pushing markdown is a very functional, lighweight publishing strategy. 

This is (sort of) another example of keeping things machine- and human-readable, which is bliss. By making `foo.Rmd` available, others can see and run your __actual code__. By sharing `foo.md` and/or `foo.html`, others can casually browse your end product and decide if they even want to bother.


#### Troubleshooting

Make sure RStudio and the `rmarkdown` package (and its dependencies) are up-to-date.

Get rid of your `.Rprofile` at least temporarily.

Insert a chunk in your `.Rmd` document so that it renders even when there are errors.

    ```{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}  
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)  
    ```
    
Tolerate errors in one specific chunk.

    ```{r wing-and-a-prayer, error = TRUE}  
    ## your sketchy code goes here ;) 
    ```

Check your working directory.

  * `getwd()`
  * `list.files()`

Don't try to change working directory within an R Markdown document.

Don't be in a hurry to create a complicated sub-directory structure.


### HTML on GitHub

I have more [general ideas](bit006_github-browsability-wins.html) about how to make a GitHub repo function as a website.


#### Be savvy about your files

Keep files in the plainest, web-friendliest form that is compatible with your main goals. Plain text is the very best. GitHub offers special handling for certain types of files:

  * Markdown files, which may be destined for conversion into, e.g., HTML
  * Markdown files named `README.md`
  * HTML files, often the result of compiling Markdown files
  * Source code, such as `.R` files
  * Delimited files, containing data one might bring into R via `read.table()`
  * PNG files
  
#### Get over your hang ups re: committing derived products
  
Let's acknowledge the discomfort some people feel about putting derived products under version control. 

The taboo of keeping derived products under version control originates from compilation of binary executables from source. Software built on a Mac would not work on Windows and so it made sense to keep these binaries out of the holy source code repository. 


#### Markdown

**Keep intermediate Markdown.** Commit both `foo.Rmd` and `foo.md`, even if you choose to `.gitignore` the final `foo.html`. As of [September 2014](https://github.com/github/markup/pull/343), GitHub renders R Markdown files nicely, like Markdown, and with proper syntax highlighting, which is great. But, of course, the code blocks just sit there un-executed, so my advice about keeping intermediate Markdown still holds. You want YAML frontmatter that looks something like [this](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/402761e30b9be8023af9#file-yaml_frontmatter_rmd_keep_md-yml) for `.Rmd`:

```{r include = FALSE}
rinline <- function(code) {
  sprintf('`r %s`', code)
}
```


``` yaml
---
title: "Something fascinating"
author: "Jenny Bryan"
date: "`r rinline("format(Sys.Date())")`"
output:
  html_document:
    keep_md: TRUE
---
```

or like [this](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/402761e30b9be8023af9#file-yaml_frontmatter_r_keep_md-yml) for `.R`:

``` yaml
#' ---
#' title: "Something fascinating"
#' author: "Jenny Bryan"
#' date: "`r rinline("format(Sys.Date())")`"
#' output:
#'   html_document:
#'     keep_md: TRUE
#' ---
```

#### `README.md`

`README.md` at the top-level of your repo as the *de facto* landing page. This is analogous to `index.html`.

Some repositories consist solely of `README.md`. 

  * Jeff Leek's write-ups on [How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) 
  
  * [Developing R packages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages). 
  
  
`README`-only repos vs gists : 

  * [PNGs README gallery](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-organization1/tree/27883c8fc4cdd4dcc6a8232f1fe5c726e96708a0/slides/organization-slides) 

#### Finding stuff

OK these are pure GitHub tips but if you've made it this far, you're obviously a keener.

  * Press `t` to activate [the file finder](https://github.com/blog/793-introducing-the-file-finder) whenever you're in a repo's file and directory view. AWESOME, especially when there are files tucked into lots of subdirectories.
  * Press `y` to [get a permanent link](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/) when you're viewing a specific file. Watch what changes in the URL. This is important if you are about to *link* to a file or [to specific lines](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23821235/how-to-link-to-specific-line-number-on-github). Otherwise your links will break easily in the future. If the file is deleted or renamed or if lines get inserted or deleted, your links will no longer point to what you intended. Use `y` to get links that include a specific commit in the URL.

#### HTML

If you have an HTML file in a GitHub repository, simply visiting the file shows the raw HTML. Here's a nice ugly example:

  * <https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/bit003_api-key-env-var.html>

No one wants to look at that. You can provide this URL to [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com) to serve this HTML more properly and get a decent preview.

You can form two different types of URLs with [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com):

  * For sharing low-traffic, temporary examples or demos with small numbers of people, do this:
    - <https://rawgit.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/master/bit003_api-key-env-var.html>
    - Basically: replace `https://github.com/` with `https://rawgit.com/`
  * For use on production websites with any amount of traffic, do this:
    - <https://cdn.rawgit.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/master/bit003_api-key-env-var.html>
    - Basically: replace `https://github.com/` with `https://cdn.rawgit.com/`
    
This sort of enhanced link might be one of the useful things to put in a `README.md` or other Markdown file in the repo.

You may also want to check out this [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-html-preview/cphnnfjainnhgejcpgboeeakfkgbkfek?hl=en) or [GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io), though recently I've more success with [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com).

Sometimes including HTML files will cause GitHub to think that your R repository is HTML. Besides being slightly annoying, this can make it difficult for people to find your work if they are searching specifically for R repos.  You can exclude these files or directories from GitHub's language statistics by [adding a .gitattributes file](https://github.com/github/linguist#using-gitattributes) that marks them as 'documentation' rather than code. [See an example here](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets/blob/master/.gitattributes).

#### Source code

You will notice that GitHub does automatic syntax highlighting for source code. For example, notice the coloring of this [R script](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial/blob/master/gapminder-ggplot2-stripplot.r). The file's extension is the primary determinant for if/how syntax highlighting will be applied. You can see information on recognized languages, the default extensions and more at [github/linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml). You should be doing it anyway, but let this be another reason to follow convention in your use of file extensions.

Note you can click on "Raw" in this context as well, to get just the plain text and nothing but the plain text.
    
#### Delimited files

GitHub will nicely render tabular data in the form of `.csv` (comma-separated) and `.tsv` (tab-separated) files. You can read more in the [blog post](https://github.com/blog/1601-see-your-csvs) announcing this feature in August 2013 or in [this GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data).

Advice: take advantage of this! If something in your repo can be naturally stored as delimited data, by all means, do so. Make the comma or tab your default delimiter and use the file suffixes GitHub is expecting. I have noticed that GitHub is more easily confused than R about things like quoting, so always inspect the GitHub-rendered `.csv` or `.tsv` file in the browser. You may need to do light cleaning to get the automagic rendering to work properly. Think of it as yet another way to learn about imperfections in your data.

Here's an example of a tab delimited file on GitHub: [lotr_clean.tsv](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr/blob/master/lotr_clean.tsv), originally found ~~here~~ (nope, IBM shut down manyeyes July 2015).

Note you can click on "Raw" in this context as well, to get just the plain text and nothing but the plain text.

#### PNGs

PNG is the "no brainer" format in which to store figures for the web. But many of us like a vector-based format, such as PDF, for general purpose figures. Bottom line: PNGs will drive you less crazy than PDFs on GitHub. To reduce the aggravation around viewing figures in the browser, make sure to have a PNG version in the repo.

Examples:

  * [This PNG figure](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A/blob/master/hw06_scaffolds/01_justR/stripplot_wordsByRace_The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.png) just shows up in the browser
  * A different figure [stored as PDF](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial/blob/master/gapminder-country-colors.pdf) ~~produces the dreaded, annoying "View Raw" speed bump. You'll have to click through and, on my OS + browser, wait for the PDF to appear in an external PDF viewer.~~ *2015-06-19 update: since I first wrote this GitHub has [elevated its treament of PDFs](https://github.com/blog/1974-pdf-viewing) so YAY. It's slow but it works.*
  
Hopefully we are moving towards a world where you can have "web friendly" and "vector" at the same time, without undue headaches. As of [October 2014](https://github.com/blog/1902-svg-viewing-diffing), GitHub provides enhanced viewing and diffing of SVGs. So don't read this advice as discouraging SVGs. Make them! But consider keeping a PNG around as emergency back up for now.
  
#### Linking to a ZIP archive of your repo

The browsability of GitHub makes your work accessible to people who care about your content but who don't (yet) use Git themselves. What if such a person wants all the files? Yes, there is a clickable "Download ZIP" button offered by GitHub. But what if you want a link to include in an email or other document? If you add `/archive/master.zip` *to the end* of the URL for your repo, you construct a link that will download a ZIP archive of your repository. Click here to try this out on a very small repo:

<https://github.com/jennybc/lotr/archive/master.zip>

Go look in your downloads folder!

#### Links and embedded figures

* To link to another page in your repo, just use a relative link: `[admin](courseAdmin/)` will link to the `courseAdmin/` directory inside the current directory. `[admin](/courseAdmin/)` will link to the top-level `courseAdmin/` directory from any where in the repo

* The same idea also works for images. `![](image.png)` will include `image.png` located in the current directory

#### Let people correct you on the internet

They love that!

You can create a link that takes people directly to an editing interface in the browser. Behind the scenes, assuming the clicker is signed into GitHub but is not you, this will create a fork in their account and send you a pull request. When I click the link below, I am able to actually commit directly to `master` for this repo.

[CLICK HERE to suggest an edit to this page!](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/edit/master/bit006_github-browsability-wins.md)

Here's what that link looks like in the Markdown source:

```
[CLICK HERE to suggest an edit to this page!](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/edit/master/bit006_github-browsability-wins.md)
```

and here it is with placeholders:

```
[INVITATION TO EDIT](<URL to your repo>/edit/master/<path to your md file>)
```

AFAIK, to do that in a slick automatic way across an entire repo/site, you need to be using Jekyll or some other automated system. But you could easily handcode such links on a small scale.
